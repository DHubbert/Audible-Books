window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An impossible mission, for a man who barely exists. </p> <p>The mysterious assassin known only as Victor is locked in an uneasy alliance with the CIA. And he has a list: Three names, three victims. Worst of all, Victor is given just two days to take down his targets, forcing him to compromise his usual extreme care. </p> <p>With each name Victor crosses off his list, the game grows far more complex - and far more lethal. A conspiracy begins to unwind and suddenly this perfect assassin becomes the perfect target. </p> <p>Zooming from Moscow to London and Washington, and loaded with suspense, twists and sex appeal, <i>The Enemy</i> is a high-octane thrill-ride ideal for fans of Lee Child.</p>";
