window.bookSummaryJSON = "In the summer of 1924, the Honourable Daisy Dalrymple Fletcher is off on a holiday by the sea with her step-daughter Belinda, Belinda's chum Deva, and Daisy's husband, Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher of Scotland Yard. Daisy is anticipating a relaxing, nondramatic holiday. But Daisy doesn't have that kind of luck. <p>It seems that a low-rent Don Juan has been busily seducing the local womenfolk, and, in a town this small, no secret is kept for long. When the Fletchers' picnic is interrupted by the discovery of a broken body at the foot of the cliff, that of the philandering local innkeeper, the unflappable Daisy Dalrymple finds herself embroiled in a mystery. </p> <p>In the continuation of her popular series, Carola Dunn vividly evokes the life and times of 1920s England, wrapped in a classic mystery to delight her many fans.</p>";
