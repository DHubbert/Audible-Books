It's not her fault - it just so turns out that she's now the only person in the entire world who can communicate with the dead. And they're a chatty bunch with a list of demands. </p> <p>When the ghosts offer information about a witch-hating mass murderer in return for Ivy's help, she has no choice but to get involved. She might be getting herself into more trouble than she realizes, though - and that's even before she's dragged to Sunday dinner so she can meet Winter's family.... </p>";
