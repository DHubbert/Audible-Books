window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The hunter becomes the hunted</b></p> <p>Bounty hunter Hal Mason is doing well for himself, a year after the System converted Earth into a lawless, apocalyptic Dungeon World.</p> <p>Now, though, old friends have come calling with a new opportunity and with it, the murky politics of Galactic interests and overlapping contracts. Hal must protect the first train to cross the new wildlands of the American Midwest.</p> <p>Broken terrain, monsters, Galactic renegades, and even System enhanced weather all plague the journey. With pressure building from external forces, hidden agendas threaten to tear the expedition apart from within.</p> <p>Will Hal persevere or will he be consumed by the System?</p> <p><i>Dungeon World Drifters</i> is the second book in the <i>System Apocalypse - Relentless</i> series. Set in the same universe as Tao Wong’s best-selling post-apocalyptic LitRPG, the <i>System Apocalypse</i>, it’s another glimpse into what humanity will do when the chips are down and the monsters are crawling from the shadows.</p>";
