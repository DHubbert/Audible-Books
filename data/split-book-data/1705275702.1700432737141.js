Rafe, as a member of the club, is not impressed with these newest Gargoyles.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a social-climbing high school friend of Lucy's is in town. Is she really after an art history degree, or is her purpose more devious?</p> <p>When someone dies during a club dinner, it looks like more than boys behaving badly. It's up to Lucy and her undead knitters to solve the crime.</p> <p>From a <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author. This is part of the Vampire Knitting Club series, but each book can be listened to as a stand-alone.
