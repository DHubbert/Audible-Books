window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Penguin presents the unabridged, downloadable, audiobook edition of <i>The Solomon Curse</i> by Clive Cussler and Russell Blake, read by Scott Brick. </p> <p>There are many rumours about the bay off Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. Some say it was the site of the lost empire of the Solomon king, and that great treasure lies beneath the waters. Others say terrible things happened here, atrocities and disappearances at the hands of cannibal giants, and those who venture there do not return. It is cursed. Which is exactly what attracts the attention of husband-and-wife treasure-hunting team Sam and Remi Fargo. How could they resist? </p> <p> Clues and whispers lead them on a hunt from the Solomons to Australia to Japan, and what they find is both wonderful and monstrous - and like nothing they have ever seen before.</p>";
