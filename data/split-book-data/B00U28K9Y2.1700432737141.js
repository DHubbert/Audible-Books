window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Welcome to Midnight, Texas. It's a quiet little town, perched at the junction between Davy Road and Witch Light Road, and it's easy to miss. With its boarded-up windows, single traffic light, and sleepy air, there's nothing special about Midnight...which is exactly how the residents like it. </p> <p>So when the news comes that a new owner plans to renovate the run-down, abandoned old hotel in town, it's not met with pleasure. Who would want to come to Midnight, with its handful of shops, the Home Cookin diner, and quiet residents - and why? But there are bigger problems in the air. </p> <p>When Manfred Bernado, the newest resident in town, is swept up in a deadly investigation, suddenly the hotel and its residents are the least of the town's concern. The police, lawyers, and journalists are all headed to Midnight, and it's the worst possible moment.... </p>";
