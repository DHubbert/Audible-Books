window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>David Baldacci's heart-stopping <i>Hour Game</i> is the second fast-paced thriller in the King and Maxwell series. </p> <p>Following their collaboration in <i>Split Second</i>, ex-Secret Service agents Sean King and Michelle Maxwell have gone into partnership and are investigating the robbery of some secret documents at the residence of the incredibly wealthy Battle family. It seems like a straightforward case of domestic burglary, but soon they begin to suspect links to larger, more terrifying events now shaking the prosperous town of Wrightsburg.... </p> <p>The unidentified corpse of an attractive young woman turns up in the woods; two high school kids, one shot in the back, the other in the face, are found dead in their car; a successful lawyer is discovered stabbed to death in her own home. A serial killer is on the loose. The murderer kills in the manner of famous killers of the past but takes care to leave a stopped watch at the scene of each crime - corresponding to the victim's position on his hit list. </p> <p>As the killing spree escalates, it seems that the fractured Battle family are somehow involved, and Maxwell and King suddenly find themselves racing to solve an intricate puzzle, one that is full of tantalizing clues but barren of solid evidence and one that is leaving even the FBI confounded. And all the while, the body count is rising.... </p> <p><i>Hour Game</i> is followed by <i>Simple Genius</i>, <i>First Family</i>, <i>The Sixth Man</i> and <i>King and Maxwell</i>. </p>";
