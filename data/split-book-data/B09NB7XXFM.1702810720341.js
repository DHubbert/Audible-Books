window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>What's worse than Australian wildlife? </b><b><i>Mutated</i></b><b> Australian wildlife.</b></p> <p><i>Audiobook has been updated with all-new male narrator and voices! </i></p> <p>The System Apocalypse has come to Australia, altering native organisms and importing even more menacing creatures to the most dangerous continent on Earth. For Kira Kent, plant biologist, the System arrives while she's pulling an all-nighter at work with her pair of kids in tow.</p> <p>Now, instead of mundane parental concerns like childcare and paying the bills, she's got to figure out how to survive a world where already-deadly flora and fauna have grown even more perilous - all while dealing with the minutiae of the Systemâ€™s pesky blue screens and Levels and somehow putting together a community of survivors to forge a safe zone to shelter her son and daughter.</p> <p>It almost makes her miss the PTA fundraising sales.<i> Almost.</i></p> <p><i>Town Under</i> is the first book in a new series, The System Apocalypse: Australia. It's set in the same universe as Tao Wong's The System Apocalypse and starts in the same time period as <i>Life in the North</i>, but focuses on the changes on the deadliest of continents, Australia. Fans of the original series, LitRPG, fantasy, science fiction, and post-apocalyptic novels will want to take a look.</p> <p>Audio narration adjusted on 2022/01/29.&nbsp;</p>";
