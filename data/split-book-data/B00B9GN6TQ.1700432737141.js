But in the turmoil of war, the treasure was scattered - and lost. Almost a century later, the haul is valued at over 3.5 billion dollars. Despite hundreds of attempts to find it, its location has remained a mystery...until now. Can the Hunters find the treasure and succeed where all others have failed?</p>";
