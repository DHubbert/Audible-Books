window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>An utterly addictive cozy mystery novel</i></p> <p>French cheese, fine wine, and...a mystifying murder?</p> <p>A delightful afternoon stroll turns to disaster when the guests of an artists’ retreat in the French mountains spot the body of a man at the bottom of a cliff. Amongst them is Melissa Craig, who, binoculars at the ready, suddenly finds herself at the center of a very puzzling mystery. Was it an accident, or was he pushed?&nbsp;</p> <p>Her suspicions are confirmed when another body is found days later in almost the exact same spot. It can’t be a coincidence; someone in this idyllic French village is up to no good, and it’s up to her to find out who.</p> <p>Between the eccentric locals and mischievous guests, Melissa finds herself with no shortage of potential suspects: Was it the surly handyman with a dark past or perhaps, the short-sighted widow with an excellent golf swing? But the real question is: How close to the edge will Melissa have to tread to find the culprit?</p> <p>An absolutely gripping murder mystery you’ll feel compelled to listen to in one sitting. Perfect for anyone who loves Agatha Christie, P.D. James, or Faith Martin.&nbsp;</p> <p>This book was previously published as <i>Over the Edge</i>.</p>";
