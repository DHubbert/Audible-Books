She’s decided to let her fictional detective retire at last and perhaps put her own days of investigating behind her, too. But the ink has barely dried on the page when Melissa receives shocking news: Her estranged father has been found dead in the family home and her mother, Sylvia, is under suspicion of murder.</p> <p>Melissa hasn’t seen her parents for nearly 30 years, but on hearing the dreadful news she rushes to her mother’s side. Melissa is sure that Sylvia could never commit a murder, but Sylvia does seem to be keeping secrets....</p> <p>With no one else to turn to, Sylvia begs Melissa to investigate the case. Melissa knows her father was a difficult man, but now she needs to work out who wanted him dead...a disgruntled employee, the controlling family lawyer, or perhaps the woman with whom he was having an affair?</p> <p>When another body is found, Melissa realizes she’s dealing with a ruthless killer. As the police close in, trying to pin both deaths on her mother, Melissa must act fast. Can she find a way to unmask the true killer before she loses her mother for a second time and possibly forever?&nbsp;</p> <p><b>If you can’t get enough of murder mysteries by Agatha Christie, Faith Martin or P.
