window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.</b></p> <p><b>'Your country needs you. Your world needs you. Your time is now.'</b></p> <p>Our politics is a mess. We have leaders who can't or shouldn't be allowed to lead. We endure governments that lie, and seek to undermine our democratic values. And we are confronted with policies that serve the interests of the privileged few. It's no surprise that so many of us feel frustrated, let down and drawn to ask, '<i>But what can I do?</i>'</p> <p>That question is the inspiration behind this book. It's a question regularly posed to Alastair Campbell, not least in reaction to <i>The Rest is Politics</i>, the chart-topping podcast he presents with former Tory Cabinet minister Rory Stewart. His answer, typically, is forthright and impassioned. We cannot afford to stand on the sidelines. If we think things need to change, then <i>we</i> need to change them, and that means getting involved.</p> <p><i>But What Can I Do? </i>provides each of us with the motivation and the tools to make a difference. It explains how we can develop our skills of advocacy and persuasion. It draws on Alastair's long experience to offer practical tips on putting together and leading a campaign team. It provides priceless advice on developing confidence and coping with criticism and setbacks. And it sets out the practical steps by which we can become political players ourselves.</p> <p>Part call to arms, part practical handbook, <i>But What Can I Do? </i>will prove required listening for anyone who wants to make a difference.</p>";
