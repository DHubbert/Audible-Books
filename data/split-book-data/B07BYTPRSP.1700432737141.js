Then meet DI Hillary Greene, a policewoman struggling to save her career and catch criminals.&nbsp;</p> <p>A would-be politician is found battered to death in the kitchen of his expensive home in a lovely Oxfordshire village. His wife’s alibi is full of holes and there’s another woman in the background. And what about his seemingly mild-mannered political rival? DI Hillary Greene tries to get to the bottom of this perplexing murder. She certainly doesn’t think the prime suspect is as guilty as everyone thinks. Just as she’s about to make a breakthrough, everything is turned upside down by a fatal development in another case she is working on....&nbsp;</p> <p>Can Hillary find the murderer and will she survive a brush with one of Oxford’s most dangerous criminals?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>This crime mystery will have you gripped from start to finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Murder in the Village</i> is the fourth in a series of crime thrillers set in Oxfordshire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The location: the picturesque village of Lower Heyford, set in North Oxfordshire's Cherwell Valley, nestles close to the Cotswolds, an area of outstanding natural beauty. Farming country, the village has been in existence in one form or another for over a thousand years, providing a natural 'ford' for oxen over the river since medieval times.

Popular with the rank and file for her no-nonsense attitude and competence. DCI Philip 'Mellow' Mallow Mel appreciates Hillary's first-rate ability to solve her cases, and isn't happy about her harassment by the officers from York. Known for his sartorial elegance and laid-back manners, he has a sharp mind, and an eye for the ladies. A good friend and ally for Hillary in her recent tribulations, he's determined to keep his best investigator focused on the problems at hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Please note:</b> this is a revised edition of a book first published as <i>By a Narrow Majority</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Discover your next favourite mystery series now, because once you start, you won’t want to stop.
