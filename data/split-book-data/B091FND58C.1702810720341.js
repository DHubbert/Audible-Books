window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Bread is supposed to be the staff of life - not a murder weapon.</b></p> <p>Every baker has their weak spot. For Poppy, it’s bread. So, when The Great British Baking Contest hits bread week, she’s as fragile as an overbaked croissant. Just when she needs to keep all her focus on flour, water, yeast, and salt, another ingredient enters the mix. Death.&nbsp;</p> <p>Someone is not who they appear to be, and secrets from the past are bringing deadly consequences to the present. Poppy isn’t only a contestant in the long-running TV show, she’s also a witch and reluctant amateur sleuth. With the rest of her coven, assorted animal helpers, and her ghostly sidekick Gerry, Poppy needs to solve the murder before someone else dies.&nbsp;</p> <p>Set in the beautiful Somerset countryside, the Great Witches Baking Contest stories are all linked, but they can be listened to as stand-alone cozy mysteries. There is no swearing, gore, or sex. Just an entertaining cozy mystery with witches, ghosts, a little romance - and recipes!&nbsp;</p> <p>From the <i>USA Today </i>best-selling author of <i>The Vampire Knitting Club</i>.</p>";
