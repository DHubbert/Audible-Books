window.bookSummaryJSON = "The divine Phryne Fisher returns in the 15th seductive installment in the classic Phryne Fisher whodunnit series. This one includes shipboard romances, champagne cocktails, erotic photographers, jealous husbands, mickey finns, blackmail, and attempted murder. <p>A succession of jewelry thefts from first-class passengers is hardly the best advertisement for a cruise liner, particularly when it is likely that it is a passenger who is doing the stealing. Phryne Fisher, with her Lulu bob, green eyes, Cupid's bow lips and Chanel traveling suits, is exactly the sort of elegant sleuth to take on a ring of jewelry thieves on the high seas - or at least, aboard the SS <i>Hinemoa</i> on a luxury cruise to New Zealand. With the Maharani - the Great Queen of Sapphires - as the bait, Phryne rises magnificently to the challenge.</p>";
