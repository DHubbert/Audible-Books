But things take a macabre turn when the first night’s screening ends with a mysterious murder, and the second night with another.... One by one the actors turn up dead in ways that eerily echo their film.</p> <p>With the police left scratching their heads, Lady Hardcastle calls upon her amateur sleuthing skills to launch an investigation, with Flo’s able assistance. Surrounded by suspects both human and supernatural, Lady Hardcastle must use a little trickery of her own to unmask the murderer.</p>";
