window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Most self-help books encourage you to think differently, to think yourself thin, imagine a richer self or visualize the perfect you. This is difficult and time consuming and often doesnâ€™t work. </p> <p>Drawing on a dazzling array of scientific evidence, psychologist Richard Wiseman presents a radical new insight that turns conventional self-help on its head: simple physical actions represent the quickest, easiest and most powerful way to instantly change how you think and feel. So don't just think about changing your life. Do it. </p>";
