window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The unabridged downloadable audiobook edition of Clive Cussler and Grant Blackwood's <i>Lost Empire</i>, the second installment of the fantastic Fargo adventure stories. Read by the award-winning narrator Scott Brick. </p> <p>While scuba diving in Tanzania, Sam and Remi Fargo come upon a relic belonging to a long-lost Confederate ship. An anomaly about the relic sets them off chasing a mystery - but, unknown to them, a much more powerful force is engaged in the same chase. Mexico's ruling party, the ultranationalist Mexica Tenochca, is intent on finding that artefact as well, because it contains a secret that could destroy the party utterly. Through Tanzania and Zanzibar, into the rainforests of Madagascar, and across the Indian Ocean to Indonesia and the legendary site of the 1883 Krakatoa explosion, the Fargos and their ruthless opponents pursue the hunt - but only one can win. And the penalty for failure is death. </p>";
