window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For anyone who loves sailing and adventure, Arthur Ransome's classic <i>Swallows and Amazons</i> series stands alone. Originally published over a half-century ago, the twelve books are still eagerly read by children and adults alike – by all those captivated by the world of adventure and imagination. Such longevity is not only due to Ransome’s unparalleled gift of storytelling, but also his championing of qualities such as independence and initiative; virtues that appeal to every generation, whether young or old. The fourth book in Arthur Ransome's classic series, <i>Winter Holiday</i> takes intrepid explorers John, Susan, Titty and Roger Walker, and fearsome Amazon pirates Nancy and Peggy Blackett to the North Pole. Joined by budding novelist Dorethes Callum and her scientist brother Dick, the children plan an ‘Arctic’ expedition. But unforeseen events separate the travellers and disaster nearly strikes in the exciting climax of their race to the Pole. </p> <p>Arthur Ransome was a prolific writer of children's books. Born in Leeds in 1884, it was his father, a nature-loving history professor, who inspired his love of the outdoors and nurtured a passion for fishing. As a child he enjoyed active, outdoor holidays: sailing, camping and exploring the countryside. He used many of these holiday settings for his children's stories, notably the much-loved <i>Swallows and Amazons</i>, a book that sits comfortably in the category of ‘timeless classic’. In 1936 he won the first ever Carnegie Medal for the sixth book in the <i>Swallows &amp; Amazons</i> series, <i>Pigeon Post</i>. </p>";
