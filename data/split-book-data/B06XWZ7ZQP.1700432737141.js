window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Split Second</i> is the first in the gripping King and Maxwell series by best-selling author David Baldacci. </p> <p>When something distracts Secret Agent Sean King for a split second, it costs him his career and presidential candidate Clyde Ritter his life. But what stole his attention? And why was Ritter shot? </p> <p> Eight years later Michelle Maxwell is on the fast track through the ranks of the Secret Service when her career is stopped short: presidential candidate John Bruno is abducted from a funeral home while under her protection. </p> <p> The similarity between the two cases drives Michelle to reopen investigations into the Ritter fiasco and join forces with attractive ex-agent King. The pair are determined to get to the bottom of what happened in those critical moments. </p> <p> Meanwhile, high-ranking members of the legal system and key witnesses from both cases are going missing. King is losing friends, colleagues and clients fast, and his ex-lover, Joan Dillinger, is playing curious games - she wants Sean back, but she also owes him for something.... </p> <p><i>Split Second</i> is followed by <i>Hour Game</i>, <i>Simple Genius</i>, <i>First Family</i>, <i>The Sixth Man</i> and <i>King and Maxwell</i>. </p>";
