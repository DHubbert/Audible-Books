window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The long-awaited follow-up to the global best-seller <i>Liar's Poker</i>, <i>The Big Short</i> tells a story of spectacular, epic folly. </p> <p>It has taken the world's greatest financial meltdown to bring Michael Lewis back to the subject that made him famous. His international best seller <i>Liar's Poker</i> exposed the greed and carnage of the City and Wall Street in the 1980s; he wrote it as a cautionary tale, but people seem to have read it as a how-to guide. Now, he wants to settle accounts. </p> <p>In this visceral tour to the heart of the money-making machine, Michael Lewis traces the origins of the crisis and introduces us to a new cast of compulsively fascinating characters. We meet the people who saw it coming, the people who were asleep at the wheel, and others who were actively driving us all off the cliff. Where did it all start? How could we have all been so deluded for quite so long? Did it really have to be this way? And who the hell can we blame? Michael Lewis has the answers. </p> <p>No one is better qualified to reveal the dark truths about how our world really works. No one else could make it such an enjoyable ride along the way. </p> <p>This edition includes a prologue read by the author, plus an exclusive author interview.</p>";
