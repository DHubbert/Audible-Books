window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Michael Lewis, the Master of the Big Story, is back with <i>Flash Boys</i>. </p> <p>If you thought Wall Street was about alpha males standing in trading pits hollering at each other, think again. That world is dead. </p> <p>Now, the world's money is traded by computer code, inside black boxes in heavily guarded buildings. Even the experts entrusted with your cash don't know what's happening to it. And the very few who do aren't about to tell - because they're making a killing. </p> <p>This is a market that's rigged, out of control and out of sight; a market in which the chief need is for speed; and in which traders would sell their grandmothers for a microsecond. Blink, and you'll miss it. </p> <p>In <i>Flash Boys</i>, Michael Lewis tells the explosive story of how one group of ingenious oddballs and misfits set out to expose what was going on. It's the story of what it's like to declare war on some of the richest and most powerful people in the world. It's about taking on an entire system. And it's about the madness that has taken hold of the financial markets today. </p> <p>You won't believe it until you've read it. </p> <p> Michael Lewis was born in New Orleans and educated at Princeton University and the London School of Economics. He has written several books including the New York Times bestsellers <i>Liar's Poker</i>, widely considered the book that defined Wall Street during the 1980s, <i>Boomerang</i> and <i>The Big Short</i>, 'probably the single best piece of financial journalism ever written' (Reuters). Lewis is contributing writer for <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> and also writes for <i>Vanity Fair</i> and <i>Portfolio</i> magazine. </p>";
