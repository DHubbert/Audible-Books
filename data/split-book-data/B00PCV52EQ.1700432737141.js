But while you can take the London copper out of London you can't take the London out of the copper.</p> <p>Travelling west with Beverley Brook, Peter soon finds himself caught up in a deep mystery and having to tackle local cops and local gods. And what's more all the shops are closed by 4pm....</p> <p>Read by Kobna Holdbrook-Smith.</p>";
