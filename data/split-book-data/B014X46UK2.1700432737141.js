She moves like a shadow; she kills silently: Raven. </p> <p>This elegant assassin has been on the run for years. This time, though, she has picked the wrong target. </p> <p>The hitman known only as \"Victor\" is as paranoid as he is merciless and is no stranger to being hunted. He tracks his would-be killer across the globe, aiming not only to neutralise the threat but to discover who wants him dead. </p> <p>The trail leads to New York...and then the lights go out. Over 12 hours of unremitting darkness, Manhattan dissolves into chaos. Amid looting, conspiracy and blackout, Victor and Raven play a vicious game of cat and mouse that the city will never forget. </p>";
