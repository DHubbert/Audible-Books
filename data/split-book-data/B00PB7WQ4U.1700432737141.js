window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The sixth audiobook in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling Ghost-in-Law series. Jadyn St. James hopes that the two-week quiet period in Mudbug means things in the small bayou town are back to normal - whatever that is. But when a fisherman finds a sunken shrimp boat, and the boat captain is missing, Jadyn wonders if the damage to the boat was caused by a storm, or if something far more nefarious happened. Colt Bertrand has been fighting his attraction to the sexy game warden since he first laid eyes on her. Once more, their jobs have forced them together, but when a stalker sets his sights on Jadyn, Coltâ€™s emotions launch into overdrive. Can he protect the bayou beauty and also protect his heart? </p>";
