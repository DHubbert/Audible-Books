When the pompous and unbearable brother of the local vicar is killed by a very large rock, dropped on his head from a great height, it seems clear to all that this campaign of gossip has escalated to murder. With the help of her husband, who'd rather she not get involved, Daisy tries to uncover who wrote the letters and who that person has driven to murder before the killer strikes again.</p>";
