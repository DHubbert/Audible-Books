window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Brought to you by Penguin.</p> <p>There's never been a better time to set new habits. This book will change your life.</p> <p>Why do we do develop habits? And how can we change them?</p> <p>We can always change. In <i>The Power of Habit</i>, award-winning <i>New York Times</i> business reporter Charles Duhigg translates cutting-edge behavioural science into practical self-improvement action, distilling advanced neuroscience into fascinating narratives of transformation.</p> <p>Why can some people and companies change overnight and some stay stuck in their old ruts? The answer lies deep in the human brain, and <i>The Power of Habits</i> reveals the secret pressure points that can change a life. From Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps to Martin Luther King Jr., from the CEO of Starbucks to the locker rooms of the NFL, Duhigg explores the incredible results of keystone habits and how they can make all the difference between billions and millions, failure and success – or even life and death.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Power of Habit</i> makes an exhilarating case: the key to almost any door in life is instilling the right habit. From exercise to weight loss, child-rearing to productivity, market disruption to social revolution and above all success, the right habits can change everything.&nbsp;</p> <p>Habits aren't destiny. They’re science, one which can transform our businesses, our communities and our lives.</p>";
