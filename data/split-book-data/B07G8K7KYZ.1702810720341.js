window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Meet Melissa: cat lover, caring mother… daring detective? </b></p> <p><b>Melissa Craig </b>is absolutely delighted with her new life in an old crumbling cottage, spending her days pruning the primroses and getting to know Binkie, the ginger cat next door. She only wishes she had made the move to the countryside sooner.</p> <p>But when a knock at the door brings news of a shocking discovery, she suddenly finds herself thrown in to the middle of a baffling mystery: the bones of a young woman have been found in the woods just behind her new home.</p> <p><b>Perhaps the little village of Upper Bembury is not as idyllic as it first seemed? </b></p> <p>Strange phone calls in the night convince Melissa that the police are barking up completely the wrong tree, so she can’t resist doing a little digging of her own. From the bingo hall to the beauty salon and beyond, her search ruffles a few feathers and uncovers many of the village’s most scandalous secrets, but gets her no closer to finding the culprit.</p> <p>The discovery of a tatty old photograph in a drawer is the final piece of the puzzle she needs, <b>but as a newcomer in this close-knit community, does Melissa have what it takes to get to the bottom of this extraordinary murder mystery alone? </b></p> <p><b>A joy to read! An absolutely unpausable whodunnit for fans of Agatha Christie, P.D. James and Faith Martin.</b></p> <p>This book was previously published as <i>A Little Gentle Sleuthing</i>.</p>";
