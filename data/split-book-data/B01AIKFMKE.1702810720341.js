window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Life Leverage philosophy is a way of living your life to get more done in less time, outsource everything and create your ideal mobile lifestyle. It is a way of thinking, feeling, deciding, doing, and then getting the results and feedback accordingly to build momentum and get closer to your vision and legacy. </p> <p>Life Leverage doesn't end with sitting on a beach drinking pina coladas, or retirement, or freedom, or balance. It allows you to live that moment-to-moment, or whatever that end goal is to you, now, and not rear-loaded, merging your passion with your profession and your vocation with your vacation. </p> <p>The Life Leverage philosophy is living a fulfilled and inspired life, in balance of passion and profession, without overly sacrificing either. The Life Leverage philosophy doesn't understand work/life balance or separation; it merges every aspect into one inspired life. </p> <p>The Life Leverage philosophy understands and accepts the balance of ups and downs, happiness and sadness, and moves towards its vision and legacy, constantly tweaking and accepting feedback. It disdains duplication and wastage; getting maximum leverage and maximum time preservation with minimum time erosion and wastage. It doesn't rear-load retirement, instead it lives continual mini-retirements. </p>";
