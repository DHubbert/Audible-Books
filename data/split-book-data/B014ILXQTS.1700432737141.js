window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Penguin presents the unabridged, downloadable audiobook edition of <i>The Kingdom</i> by Clive Cussler and Grant Blackwood, read by Scott Brick. </p> <p>Whether it's lost treasure or missing persons, the Fargos find themselves in a heap of trouble every time.... </p> <p>When Texas oil baron Charlie King contacts Sam and Remi Fargo, he has an unusual request. He hired an investigator - and good friend of the pair - to locate his missing father in the Far East. But now the investigator has vanished. Would Sam and Remi be willing to look for them both? </p> <p>Though something about the request doesn't quite add up, Sam and Remi agree to help out. </p> <p>It's a journey that takes the Fargos to Tibet, Nepal, Bulgaria, India and China. They get mixed up with black-market fossils, a centuries-old puzzle chest, the ancient Nepali kingdom of Mustang, a balloon aircraft from a century before its time...and an extraordinary skeleton that might turn the history of human evolution on its head. Oh, and not a few unfriendly people with guns and itchy trigger fingers.... </p> <p>Packed with endless imagination and breathtaking suspense, <i>The Kingdom</i> is a spectacular new Clive Cussler adventure. </p>";
