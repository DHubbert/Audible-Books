window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Whether you suffer from depression yourself or hope to gain a better understanding of someone who does, <i>Reasons to Stay Alive</i> is an unfailingly honest account of life at its bleakest, but one that simultaneously manages to deliver a powerfully positive message.&nbsp;</p> <p>What does it mean to feel truly alive? Aged 24, Matt Haig's world caved in. He could see no way to go on living.&nbsp;</p> <p>This is the true story of how he came through crisis, triumphed over an illness that almost destroyed him and learned to live again.&nbsp;</p> <p>A moving, funny and joyous exploration of how to live better, love better and feel more alive, <i>Reasons to Stay Alive</i> is more than a memoir. It is a book about making the most of your time on earth.&nbsp;</p> <p>'I wrote this book because the oldest clich√©s remain the truest. Time heals. The bottom of the valley never provides the clearest view. The tunnel does have light at the end of it, even if we haven't been able to see it.... Words, just sometimes, really can set you free.'</p>";
