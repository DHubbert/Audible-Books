window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bill Nighy, Barbara Shelley and Peter Sallis are among the cast in six classic BBC Radio dramatisations of stories by one of Britain's most popular science fiction authors. </p> <p>'The Day of the Triffids', first broadcast in 1968, is set in a world in which most people have been left blind after a meteor shower, and lethal carnivorous triffids are roaming the land. 'The Kraken Wakes', dramatised for radio in 1998, is a gripping story of monsters from the deep, alien invasion and ecological disaster. </p> <p>'The Chrysalids', first broadcast in 1981, explores the dangers of being different, while the 1989 adaptation of short story 'Survival' focuses on the lengths people will go to in order to survive. </p> <p>'The Midwich Cuckoos', broadcast in 2003, is a disturbing tale of a village sealed off from the world for a day and subsequently taken over by terrifying inhuman children. </p> <p>Dramatised for radio in 1998, 'Chocky' is a chilling tale of a boy who appears to be communicating with an invisible friend. Also included is 'Beware the Stare!', a half-hour radio documentary looking at 'The Midwich Cuckoos' in print and on screen. </p> <p>Note: These are the BBC Transcription versions of <i>The Day of the Triffids</i>, prepared for sale to overseas territories. At the time, 12 minutes of material was deleted from these episodes to bring down the running time.
