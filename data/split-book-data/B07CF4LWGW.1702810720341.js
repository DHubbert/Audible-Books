window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Looking for a brilliant best-selling murder mystery with a feisty female detective? Then meet DI Hillary Greene, a policewoman struggling to save her career and catch criminals.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fifteen-year-old Billy Davies is found dead in his father's shed with a pair of gardening shears thrust brutally into his chest. DI Hillary Greene tries to get to the bottom of this baffling crime. How did Billy come into contact with such a vicious killer? Who wanted him dead - and why? The investigation reveals that the teenager was not such an innocent young man. Meanwhile, Hillary's having a tough time at work. She's been passed over for promotion, and her reliable constable Tommy Lynch is to be transferred out. But Hillary won't let distractions get in the way of solving crimes. To catch this killer, she will need to dig deep into the dark secrets of a small community. <i>Murder in the Family</i> is the fifth in a series of crime thrillers set in Oxfordshire.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The Location</b><br> The crime happens in an allotment shed in a small Oxfordshire hamlet. Allotments, or strips of land rented by individuals to grow fruit and vegetables (or flowers for flower shows), have always been popular. During the war years, they were a valuable source of food, and in modern times, their popularity hasn’t waned either, as the growing taste for organic fruit and veg, and ‘getting back to nature’ appeals to a wide range of people. Beekeepers find them very useful too. Waiting lists can be long, as they represent a perfect way to de-stress after a day in the city, and provide a peaceful haven for many people. But in the tiny hamlet of Aston Lea, set in fields of barley, and sheltered from the world and the roads by towering Hawthorne hedges, the allotments are a perfect, secret, quiet place to commit murder.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The Detectives</b> <br> DI Hillary Greene: An attractive woman in her forties, Hillary Greene is a police officer of many years’ experience, and came up through the ranks. Consequently, she knows how the system works, and is fiercely loyal to the force without being blinkered to its faults. She is a long-standing friend of her immediate superior officer, 'Mellow' Mallow and enjoys a rather enigmatic relationship with the steely Superintendent Marcus Donleavy. Popular with the rank and file for her no-nonsense attitude and competence.&nbsp;</p> <p>DCI Philip 'Mellow' Mallow: Mel appreciates Hillary's first-rate ability to solve her cases, and isn't happy about her harassment by the officers from York. Known for his sartorial elegance and laid-back manners, he has a sharp mind, and an eye for the ladies. A good friend and ally for Hillary in her recent tribulations, he's determined to keep his best investigator focused on the problems at hand.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Please note this is a revised edition of a book first published as </b><b><i>Through a Narrow Door</i></b><b>.</b>&nbsp;</p>";
