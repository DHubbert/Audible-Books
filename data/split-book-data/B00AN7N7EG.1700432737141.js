window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Brought to you by Penguin.&nbsp;</b></p> <p><i>Quiet</i>, the <i>Sunday Times</i> and <i>New York Times</i> best seller by Susan Cain, will permanently change how we see introverts - and how you see yourself.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our lives are driven by a fact most of us can't name and don't understand: whether we're an introvert or an extrovert. This defines who our friends and lovers are, which careers we choose and whether we blush when we're embarrassed.&nbsp;</p> <p>At least a third of us are on the introverted side. Some of the world's most talented people are introverts. Without them, we wouldn't have the Apple computer, the theory of relativity and Van Gogh's sunflowers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet extroverts have taken over. Shyness, sensitivity and seriousness are often seen as being negative. Introverts feel reproached for being the way they are.</p> <p>In <i>Quiet</i>, Susan Cain shows how the brain chemistry of introverts and extroverts differs and how society misunderstands and undervalues introverts. She gives introverts the tools to better understand themselves and take full advantage of their strengths.</p>";
