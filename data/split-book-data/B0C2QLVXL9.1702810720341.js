window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Still haunted by her encounter with the Taleen Praetorians, Ilea makes her way south to join the Shadow’s Hand and hone her skills. Having fought alongside members of the infamous mercenary order, she hopes to meet kindred spirits who share her completely reasonable passion for battle, adrenaline, and near-death experiences.&nbsp;</p> <p>She is looking for a team to rely on, to punch, and get punched by. Because every \"friendly yet bloody\" sparring match levels her resistances and makes her a little bit harder to kill. She might even stick around for a while. So long as the food is good.</p> <p>This guild of high-level warriors is the perfect place to grow and recuperate. To take a breath after the nonstop elven attacks, dungeons, necromancers, and Taleen murder machines. Ilea jumps headfirst into her newfound challenge, unaware of the fresh dangers already beginning to stir throughout Elos. Even their Shadow’s Hand training will not prepare Ilea and her new team for what’s to come.</p> <p>After all, there’s always another Drake.</p> <p>About the series: Join Ilea as she is transported to a world full of monsters and magic, where power is measured by one's class, level, and skills. Watch her grow in power, and recklessness, as she wields ancient hand-to-hand combat magic that can both heal and destroy. This Isekai story has a dual-class LitRPG system where every skill, class, and ability can evolve. Ilea’s tale is equal parts comfy slice-of-life wanderings, goofy jokes, and brutal, blood-pumping battles with nightmarish monsters. Join her as she delves into forgotten dungeons, hoards snacks, and generally does whatever she feels like.</p>";
