Mutated insects, carnivorous toads, and angry drop bears were not on the school curriculum, but when the apocalypse hits, you roll with it. Parenting a teenager has prepared Kira for the worst; she just didnâ€™t expect that to include the end of the world.<br> <br> A menacing conglomerate of alien hunters is breathing down their necks, and new threats lurk just over the hills. Kira and the rest of the Australian survivors of Brisbane must level up, bolster defenses, and prepare for an incoming invasion none of them foresaw.<br> <br> In-between all that, she'll need to keep her family intact and functioning. All in a day's work for a single mom, really.</p> <p><b><i>Flat Out</i></b><b> is the second book in The System Apocalypse: Australia series. Set in the same universe as Tao Wong's the System Apocalypse, it's focusing on the changes in the deadliest of continents: Australia.
