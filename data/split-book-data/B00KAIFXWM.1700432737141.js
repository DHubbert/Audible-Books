window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From <i>NY Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> best-selling author, Jana DeLeon, the third book in the Ghost-in-Law mystery/romance series. </p> <p>Family can be the death of you… </p> <p>Who killed Helena Henry? The shorter list may be who didn’t want her dead. Psychic Raissa Bordeaux thought she’d left her former life behind, hidden away in her eclectic shop in the French Quarter. But when a child is kidnapped and Helena Henry appears, Raissa risks her true identity by offering the police help with the case. New Orleans Detective Zach Blanchard doesn’t believe in psychic hooey and is certain Raissa didn’t get her facts about the case from a crystal ball. He suspects her of something besides being the most intriguing and attractive woman he’s ever come across. But when Raissa’s secrets put her in danger, can Zach convince her to trust him with the truth before it’s too late?</p>";
