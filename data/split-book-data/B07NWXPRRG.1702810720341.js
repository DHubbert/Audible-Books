But next to the stream a young woman lies dead, her once bright blonde hair now limp and lifeless...</b></p> <p>Melissa Craig has settled into a new job in the charming Cotswolds village of Upper Benbury. She is teaching French to several of the local teenagers, which gives her a fascinating insight into the young people’s lives. Material for a new novel, perhaps....
