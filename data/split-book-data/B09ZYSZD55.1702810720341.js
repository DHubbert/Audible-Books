window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>November 1907. George Dillman and Genevieve Masefield sail from Liverpool to New York on the maiden voyage of the luxurious <i>Mauretania</i>. Employed by the Cunard Line again as private detectives, they pose as passengers on what proves to be a very eventful crossing.</p> <p>Dillman is instrumental in rescuing a crew member from being washed overboard in severe weather, but he is unable to save one of the first-class passengers from the same fate. At first, it looks like a case of death by misadventure, but is the presence of a record shipment of gold bullion on board just too great a coincidence? Dillman and Genevieve must fathom the motive for murder before it is too late.</p> <p>Previously published under the name Conrad Allen, the Ocean Liner series is relaunched for a new generation of listeners.</p>";
