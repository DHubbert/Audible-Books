window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Corinna Chapman, talented baker and reluctant investigator, is trying very hard to do nothing at all on her holidays. Her gorgeous Daniel is only intermittently at her side (he's roaming the streets tracking down a multi-thousand-dollar corporate theft). Jason, her baking offsider, has gone off to learn how to surf. And Kylie and Goss are fulfilling their lives' ambition auditioning for a soapie. It should be a time of quiet reflection for Corinna, but quiet reflection doesn't seem to suit her - she's bored. Scenting a whiff of danger, Corinna accepts an offer from a caterer friend to do the baking for the film set of a new soap called <i>Kiss the Bride</i> - the soapie in which Kylie and Goss have parts. Twists and turns and complications that could only happen to Corinna ensue, involving, bizarrely, nursery rhymes and a tiger called Tabitha. </p> <p>Meanwhile, on the other side of town, a young woman is being unmercifully bullied by her corporate employers - employers who spend a lot of time cooking the books.</p>";
