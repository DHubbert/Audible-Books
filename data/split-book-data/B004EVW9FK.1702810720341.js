window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The second installment in the delicious Corinna Chapman series by best-selling cozy crime writer Kerry Greenwood.</p> <p>Corinna Chapman likes the quiet life: good food, good company, and her daily work as a baker. She doesn't really want mystery and intrigue in her life. Unfortunately for her, she doesn't have much choice. Corinna's apartment building seems to be a magnet for mystery and mayhem and, with her new lover, Daniel, a private investigator, Corinna seems destined to be involved in solving these mysteries. </p> <p>This second book in the series sees a prankster spiking the chocolates at the nearby Heavenly Pleasures chocolate store (is it an elaborate and horrible joke, or a warning of worse to come?), an attempt to blow up the apartment block, and strange new residents moving in.</p>";
