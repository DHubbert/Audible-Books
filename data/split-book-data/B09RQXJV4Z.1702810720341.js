window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Bloomsbury presents <i>I May Be Wrong</i> by Björn Natthiko Lindeblad, read by Thom Petty.</p> <p>Let me tell you what this audiobook is not. It's not about religion. It's not about telling you how to live your life. It's not about taking on a new set of beliefs. Plain and simple, it's about how to relate to your own thoughts and emotions in a way that makes your life more enjoyable, more free, brighter, clearer and wiser.</p> <p>We like to think we understand what’s happening around us; that we can determine the path our life takes. But often, things don’t go that way - in fact, they rarely do.</p> <p>From former forest monk Björn Natthiko Lindeblad, <i>I May Be Wrong</i> was a Swedish sensation. It is a book of timeless wisdom about how to handle the uncertainty that is a natural part of life.</p> <p>What helps us to live freely? How can we find comfort in difficult times? Is there a way to stay humble in the heat of the moment? And what stands out as most important when things are coming to an end?</p> <p>Infusing the everyday with heart and grace,<i> I May Be Wrong</i> is an audiobook to help us all navigate the realities of modern life.</p>";
