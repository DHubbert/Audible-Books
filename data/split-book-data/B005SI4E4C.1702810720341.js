window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The unabridged, downloadable audiobook edition of Clive Cussler and Grant Blackwood's debut title in the Fargo adventure series, <i>Spartan Gold</i>, read by the award-winning narrator Scott Brick. </p> <p>Thousands of years ago, the mighty Persian king Xerxes the Great was said to have raided the Treasury at Delphi, carrying away two solid gold pillars as a tribute to his glory. </p> <p>In 1800, while crossing the Pennine Alps, Napoleon Bonaparte and his army stumbled across the pillars. Unable to transport them, Napoleon created an inscrutable map on the labels of twelve bottles of rare wine. When Napoleon died, the bottles disappeared - and the gold pillars were lost once again. </p> <p>Treasure-hunters Sam and Remi Fargo are exploring the Great Pocomoke Swamp in Delaware when they are shocked to discover a German U-boat. Inside, they find a bottle taken from Napoleon's 'lost cellar'. Fascinated, the Fargos set out to find the rest of the collection. But another connoisseur of sorts has been looking for the bottle they've just found. But not for the wine; he wants what the bottle may lead to. For he is Hadeon Bondaruk - a half-Russian, half-Persian millionaire - and he claims descent from King Xerxes himself. </p> <p>And the treasure will be his, no matter what.... </p>";
