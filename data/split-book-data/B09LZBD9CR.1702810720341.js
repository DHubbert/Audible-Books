window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Just desserts?</p> <p>It’s November in Sinful, and everyone is gearing up for Thanksgiving. But when Fortune, Ida Belle, and Gertie bag a body on their turkey-hunting trip, the quiet enjoyment of fall is over. No one really knew Miles Broussard well, and as he’d recently sold the building his business was in to retire in another state, no one could explain how he’d ended up murdered and dumped in the bayou.</p> <p>Ally Lemarque has been waiting her entire life to open her bakery, and that day finally arrived when she purchased the building from Miles. But when she visits the site late at night and interrupts an intruder, she comes away with a crack on her head and concerns about why someone would break into an empty building.</p> <p>Fortune doesn’t think for a minute that Miles’ murder and the attack on Ally are unrelated. And Swamp Team 3 won’t rest until they’re sure Ally is safe.</p>";
