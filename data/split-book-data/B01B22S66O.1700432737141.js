They know cold iron will hold back the beasts in the darkness. They know it is dangerous to stand between two mirrors. And they know that despite their dwindling numbers, it remains their duty to protect humanity from the predations of the supernatural. And vice versa. </p> <p>But two of the society's strongest members, Mr. Sharp and Sara Falk, are trapped in the world between the mirrors, looking for each other, searching for a way back home. What they discover there will have ominous consequences both for The Oversight and the world it protects - effects that will make them question everything they thought they knew. </p> <p>The dark waters rise. The candle is guttering. But the light still remains. For now.... </p>";
