When he visits Dan in jail, he finds that time hasn't healed old wounds. There's too much bad blood between the men, and although Will feels no good will come of staying around, he is persuaded to confront his demons by fellow agent Jessica Reel. </p> <p>But then another murder changes everything, and stone-cold killer Robie will finally have to come to grips with his toughest assignment of all. His family. </p>";
