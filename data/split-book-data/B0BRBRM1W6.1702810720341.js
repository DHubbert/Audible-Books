A master of martial arts. A lord of spiritual power. Unfortunately for him, he died, and now <i>I’m</i> stuck in his body.</p> <p>And you know what? Things ain’t actually all that bad.</p> <p>I mean, last year was pretty hectic. I died, got reborn, ran away from my sect and ultimate power, started a farm, made some friends, awakened all my animals into Spirit Beasts so now they’re running around talking and getting into life-and-death battles with super-powered bandits . . .</p> <p>Oh! And I got married. Pretty neat, huh?</p> <p>Well, this year, after the Spring Planting season, I’m <i>really</i> gonna relax and put down roots. It’s the slow life for me. Sure, the talking animals and cultivators coming to live with me are a bit weird, but this year everything is gonna be basically<i> normal.</i></p> <p>There <i>definitely </i>won’t be any Heavenly Tribulations, ancient formations, or cultivator issues to deal with . . .</p> <p><b>The second volume of the blockbuster progression-fantasy series—with more than 20 million views on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
