So when someone kills him, there is no shortage of suspects. Unfortunately, Ally is at the top of the list.</p> <p>Fortune, Ida Belle, and Gertie know that Ally isn’t capable of murdering anyone, but with an ambitious ADA looking to make a name for himself, and the local gossip train intent on finding someone to blame, they know they have to find the killer and clear Ally’s name.</p>";
