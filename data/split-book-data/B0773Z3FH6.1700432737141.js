window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Winner of the Costa First Novel Award 2018</b></p> <p>A brilliantly original high-concept murder mystery from a fantastic new talent: <i>Gosford Park</i> meets <i>Inception</i> by way of Agatha Christie.&nbsp;</p> <p>'Somebody's going to be murdered at the ball tonight. It won't appear to be a murder, and so the murderer won't be caught. Rectify that injustice and I'll show you the way out.'&nbsp;</p> <p>It is meant to be a celebration, but it ends in tragedy. As fireworks explode overhead, Evelyn Hardcastle, the young and beautiful daughter of the house, is killed. But Evelyn will not die just once. Until Aiden - one of the guests summoned to Blackheath for the party - can solve her murder, the day will repeat itself over and over again. Every time ending with the fateful pistol shot.&nbsp;</p> <p>The only way to break this cycle is to identify the killer. But each time the day begins again, Aiden wakes in the body of a different guest. And someone is determined to prevent him ever escaping Blackheath....&nbsp;</p>";
