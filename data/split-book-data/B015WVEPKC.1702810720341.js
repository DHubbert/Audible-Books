window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Considered one of China's great classical novels, Wu Ch'êng-ên's <i>Journey to the West</i> was translated by Arthur Waley in abridged form as <i>Monkey</i> in 1942 and has delighted English readers ever since. It is a riveting adventure story about a priest's quest to obtain holy Buddhist scriptures for the Tang emperor; joining him on this rollicking journey: Sandy, Pigsy, and the mischievous monkey king, Sun Wukong, whose flying cloud and magic cudgel are never far from his infamous deeds. Waley's accessible rendition of Wu Ch'êng-ên's novel has become a classic in its own right: Gods, demons, and disobedient monkey spirits all come alive in this entertaining work. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</b></p>";
