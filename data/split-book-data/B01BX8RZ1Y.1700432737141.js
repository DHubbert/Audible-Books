window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the international best seller <i>The Power of Habit, </i>Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charles Duhigg explained why we do what we do. In <i>Smarter Faster Better</i>, he applies the same relentless curiosity, rigorous reporting and rich storytelling to explain how we can get better at the things we do. The result is a groundbreaking exploration of the science of productivity. </p> <p>A group of data scientists at Google embark on a four-year study of how the best teams function and find that how a group interacts is much more important than who is in the group. </p> <p>A marine corps general, faced with low morale among recruits, reimagines boot camp - and discovers that instilling a 'bias toward action' can turn even the most directionless teenagers into self-motivating achievers.</p> <p>The filmmakers behind Disney's <i>Frozen </i>are on the brink of catastrophe - until they shake up their team in just the right way, spurring a creative breakthrough that leads to one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. </p> <p>What do these people have in common? They know that productivity relies on making certain choices. The way we frame our daily decisions; the big ambitions we embrace and the easy goals we ignore; the cultures we establish as leaders to drive innovation: these are the things that separate the merely busy from the genuinely productive. </p> <p>At the core of <i>Smarter Faster Better</i> are eight key concepts - from motivation and goal setting to focus and decision making - that explain why some people and companies get so much done. Drawing on the latest findings in neuroscience, psychology and behavioural eco­nomics - as well as the experiences of CEOs, educational reformers, four-star generals, airplane pilots and Broadway songwriters - this painstakingly researched book explains that the most productive people, companies and organizations don't merely act differently. </p> <p>They view the world, and their choices, in profoundly different ways. </p>";
