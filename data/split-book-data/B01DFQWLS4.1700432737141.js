window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In late 1923, the newly married Daisy Dalrymple and her husband, Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher of Scotland Yard, come to America for a honeymoon visit. In the midst of a pleasure trip, however, both work in a bit of business - Alec travels to Washington, DC, to consult with the US government, Daisy to New York to meet with her American magazine editor. </p> <p>While in New York, Daisy stays at the famed Hotel Chelsea, which is not only close to the Flatiron Building offices of <i>Abroad</i> magazine, where she'll be meeting with her editor, but home to many of New York's artists and writers. </p> <p>After her late-morning meeting, Daisy agrees to accompany her editor, Mr. Thorwald, to lunch. But as they are leaving the offices, they hear a gunshot and see a man plummeting down an elevator shaft. The man killed was one of her fellow residents at the Hotel Chelsea, Otis Carmody, who was a journalist with no end of enemies - personal and professional - who would delight in his death. Again in the midst of a murder investigation, Daisy's search for the killer takes her to all levels of society - and even on a mad dash across the country - as she attempts to solve a puzzle that would baffle even Philo Vance himself. </p>";
