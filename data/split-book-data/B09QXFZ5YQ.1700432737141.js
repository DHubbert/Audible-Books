The organ of knowledge and the one we know least about.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over 12 episodes Stephen explores just how much weâ€™ve learned about this mysterious structure in recent years and tries to answer some of the most difficult questions that remain.&nbsp;</p> <p>To do this, we relay the discoveries and stories of neuroscientists, psychologists, anthropologists and even philosophers, to add illumination and perspective as we travel. Each episode will be full of brainy stories: some shocking, some thrilling, some scarcely believable.&nbsp;</p> <p>A SamFry Production for Audible Originals.&nbsp;</p>";
