window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For years, two sisters have vied for the turf of their dead crime boss father. Across the streets of Guatemala City, bodies have piled up; the US Drug Enforcement Agency, operating far from its own borders, is powerless to stop the fighting.&nbsp;</p> <p>But now one sister has a weapon that could finally win the war - a cold, amoral hitman known, fittingly, as 'Victor'.&nbsp;</p> <p>Freed from previous employers the CIA and MI6, Victor is a killer for hire whose sense of self-preservation trumps all else. Yet as betrayal and counterbetrayal unspool in the vicious family feud, Victor finds himself at the centre of a storm even he could be powerless to stop.</p> <p>Acclaimed best seller Tom Wood blows the competition away with his twisting, relentless new thriller, perfect for fans of Gregg Hurwitz (<i>Orphan X</i>, <i>The Nowhere Man</i>), James Swallow (<i>Nomad</i>, <i>Exile</i>) and Terry Hayes (<i>I Am Pilgrim</i>, <i>Day of the Locust</i>).</p>";
