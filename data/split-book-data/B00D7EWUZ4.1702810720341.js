window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>For anyone who loves sailing and adventure, Arthur Ransome's classic <i>Swallows and Amazons</i> series stands alone. Originally published over a half-century ago, the twelve books are still eagerly read by children and adults alike – by all those captivated by the world of adventure and imagination. Such longevity is not only due to Ransome’s unparalleled gift of storytelling, but also his championing of qualities such as independence and initiative; virtues that appeal to every generation, whether young or old. <i>Swallowdale</i> (originally published in 1931) is the second title in Arthur Ransome's classic series. It follows the Walker family and friends through a shipwreck, a camp on the mainland, a secret valley and cave, and a thrilling mountain hike. </p> <p>Arthur Ransome was a prolific writer of children's books. Born in Leeds in 1884, it was his father, a nature-loving history professor, who inspired his love of the outdoors and nurtured a passion for fishing. As a child he enjoyed active, outdoor holidays: sailing, camping and exploring the countryside. He used many of these holiday settings for his children's stories, notably the much-loved <i>Swallows and Amazons</i>, a book that sits comfortably in the category of ‘timeless classic’. In 1936 he won the first ever Carnegie Medal for the sixth book in the <i>Swallows &amp; Amazons</i> series, <i>Pigeon Post</i>. </p>";
