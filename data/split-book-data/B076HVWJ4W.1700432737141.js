window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Random House presents the audiobook edition of <i>Persuader</i> by Lee Child, read by Jeff Harding. </p> <p>Never forgive, never forget. That's Jack Reacher's operating principle. And Quinn was one of the worst guys he ever had the misfortune to meet. He had done unforgivable things. So Reacher was glad to know Quinn was dead. Until the day he saw someone who looked an awful lot like him, alive and well, riding in a limousine outside Boston's Symphony Hall. </p> <p>Never apologise. Never explain. When Reacher witnesses a brutal attempt to kidnap a terrified young student on a New England campus, he takes the law into his own hands. That's his way, after all. Only this time, it leads to a fatal shooting. Has Reacher - shockingly - lost his sense of right and wrong? Just because this time, it's personal? </p>";
