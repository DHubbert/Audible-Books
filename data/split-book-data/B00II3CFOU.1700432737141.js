window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Now a major BBC drama: The Strike series.</p> <p>When novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike. At first, she just thinks he has gone off by himself for a few days - as he has done before - and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home.</p> <p>But as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realises. The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows. If the novel were published it would ruin lives - so there are a lot of people who might want to silence him.</p> <p>And when Quine is found brutally murdered in bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any he has encountered before....</p> <p>A compulsively readable crime novel with twists at every turn, <i>The Silkworm</i> is the second in the highly acclaimed series featuring Cormoran Strike and his determined young assistant Robin Ellacott.</p> <p><b>Please note: This audiobook contains explicit language</b></p>";
