window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Random House presents the audiobook edition of <i>Hello World</i> by Hannah Fry.&nbsp;</p> <p>You are accused of a crime. Who would you rather determined your fate - a human or an algorithm?</p> <p>An algorithm is more consistent and less prone to error of judgment. Yet a human can look you in the eye before passing sentence.&nbsp;</p> <p>You need a liver transplant to save your life. Who would you want in charge of organ allocation?</p> <p>An algorithm can match organ donors with patients, potentially saving many more lives. But it may send you to the back of the queue.&nbsp;</p> <p>You’re buying a (driverless) car. One vehicle is programmed to save as many lives as possible in a collision. Another promises to prioritise the lives of its passengers. Which do you choose?&nbsp;</p> <p>Welcome to the age of the algorithm, the story of a not-too-distant future where machines rule supreme, making important decisions - in health care, transport, finance, security, what we watch, where we go, even whom we send to prison. So how much should we rely on them? What kind of future do we want?</p> <p>Hannah Fry takes us on a tour of the good, the bad and the downright ugly of the algorithms that surround us. In <i>Hello World</i> she lifts the lid on their inner workings, demonstrates their power, exposes their limitations and examines whether they really are an improvement on the humans they are replacing.</p>";
