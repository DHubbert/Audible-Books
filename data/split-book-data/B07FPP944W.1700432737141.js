He has spent half a year building relationships with the existing power structure - but all of that is thrown into chaos when the Fae leadership dictates that Calgary’s Court split into Seelie and Unseelie factions. Backed by the highest authority, the new Lord Andrell is there to build an Unseelie Court from nothing, and he will brook no interference, no challenges.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, a rogue Fae launches a vicious slaughter at Calgary’s largest public event, and Jason is dragged into an investigation and pursuit of a monster far more powerful than he is. The rogue’s Unseelie heritage brings him into conflict with Lord Andrell, and the city’s peace is threatened.&nbsp;</p> <p>One wrong step could unleash civil war between the new courts, and Jason’s own secrets could lead to lighting the embers of a civil war among all Fae - embers that have slumbered since before his birth.&nbsp;</p> <p>If only he knew what those secrets were....&nbsp;</p>";
