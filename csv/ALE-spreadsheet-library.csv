What makes some people so good? And can this talent be taught? </p> <p>In <i>Superforecasting</i>, Tetlock and coauthor Dan Gardner offer a masterwork on prediction, drawing on decades of research and the results of a massive, government-funded forecasting tournament. The Good Judgment Project involves tens of thousands of ordinary people - including a Brooklyn filmmaker, a retired pipe installer, and a former ballroom dancer - who set out to forecast global events. Some of the volunteers have turned out to be astonishingly good. They've beaten other benchmarks, competitors, and prediction markets. They've even beaten the collective judgment of intelligence analysts with access to classified information. They are ""superforecasters"". </p> <p>In this groundbreaking and accessible book, Tetlock and Gardner show us how we can learn from this elite group. Superforecasting offers the first demonstrably effective way to improve our ability to predict the future - whether in business, finance, politics, international affairs, or daily life - and is destined to become a modern classic. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</b></p>","Becoming Bulletproof, Winning Minds, The Stoic Challenge, Working Backwards, The Signal and the Noise, Left Brain, Right Stuff, Thinking in Bets, Strategy, Brilliant Mistakes, Power, Freedom, and Grace, Same as Ever, Alchemy, Everybody Lies, I Am My Brand, Alpha Trader, The Great Mental Models, Volume 2, Superintelligence, Fooled by Randomness",https://audible.co.uk/pd/B0131RJ3KG?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.co.uk/bk/adbl/013483/bk_adbl_013483_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B0131RJ3KG,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LafZreGvL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Philip%20Tetlock%20-%20Superforecasting,The Art and Science of Prediction,,

From batting averages and political polls to game shows and medical research, the real-world application of statistics continues to grow by leaps and bounds. How can we catch schools that cheat on standardized tests? How does Netflix know which movies you'll like? What is causing the rising incidence of autism? As best-selling author Charles Wheelan shows us in <i>Naked Statistics,</i> the right data and a few well-chosen statistical tools can help us answer these questions and more. </p> <p>For those who slept through Stats 101, this book is a lifesaver. Wheelan strips away the arcane and technical details and focuses on the underlying intuition that drives statistical analysis. He clarifies key concepts such as inference, correlation, and regression analysis, reveals how biased or careless parties can manipulate or misrepresent data, and shows us how brilliant and creative researchers are exploiting the valuable data from natural experiments to tackle thorny questions. </p> <p>You’ll encounter clever Schlitz Beer marketers leveraging basic probability, an International Sausage Festival illuminating the tenets of the central limit theorem, and a head-scratching choice from the famous game show <i>Let’s Make a Deal</i> - and you’ll come away with insights each time. With the wit, accessibility, and sheer fun that turned <i>Naked Economics</i> into a best seller, Wheelan defies the odds yet again by bringing another essential, formerly unglamorous discipline to life.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</b></p>","Naked Money, Data Science for Business, Storytelling with Data, Everybody Lies, The AI Delusion, A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics, Welcome to the Universe, Bernoulli's Fallacy, The Signal and the Noise, The Great Mental Models, Volume 2, Testosterone, Think Like a Rocket Scientist, Too Big to Jail, The Model Thinker, Superfreakonomics, Sway, How the Mind Works, What a Wonderful World",https://audible.co.uk/pd/B00CH3TWW0?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.co.uk/bk/adbl/011763/bk_adbl_011763_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B00CH3TWW0,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ro36VvUoL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Charles%20Wheelan%20-%20Naked%20Statistics,Stripping the Dread from the Data,,

His recurring cast of characters and American landscape was perhaps the most controversial of his canon; it was felt by many at the time to be a disappointing successor to <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, which had made Vonnegut's literary reputation. </p> <p>The core of the novel is Kilgore Trout, a familiar character very deliberately modeled on the science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon (1918-1985), a fact which Vonnegut conceded frequently in interviews and which was based upon his own occasional relationship with Sturgeon. Here Kilgore Trout is an itinerant wandering from one science fiction convention to another; he intersects with the protagonist, Dwayne Hoover (one of Vonnegut's typically boosterish, lost, and stupid mid-American characters), and their intersection is the excuse for the evocation of many others, familiar and unfamiliar, dredged from Vonnegut's gallery. The central issue is concerned with intersecting and apposite views of reality, and much of the narrative is filtered through Trout, who is neither certifiably insane nor a visionary writer but can pass for either depending upon Dwayne Hoover's (and Vonnegut's) view of the situation. </p> <p>America, when this novel was published, was in the throes of Nixon, Watergate, and the unraveling of our intervention in Vietnam; the nation was beginning to fragment ideologically and geographically, and Vonnegut sought to cram all of this dysfunction (and a goofy, desperate kind of hope, the irrational comfort given through the genre of science fiction) into a sprawling narrative whose sense, if any, is situational, not conceptual. Reviews were polarized; the novel was celebrated for its bizarre aspects and became the basis of a Bruce Willis movie adaptation whose reviews were not nearly so polarized.

Read by Mike Chamberlain. On average, people squander forty days annually trying to remember things they’ve forgotten. Joshua Foer used to be one of those people. But after a year of training, he found himself in the finals of the U.S. Memory Championship. He also discovered a truth we too often forget: In every way, we are the sum of our memories. In Moonwalking with Einstein Foer draws on cutting-edge research, the cultural history of memory and the techniques of 'mental atheletes' to transform our understanding of human remembering. He learns the ancient methods used by Cicero and Medieval scholars. </p> <p>He meets amnesiacs, neuroscientists and savants - including a man who claims to have memorized more than nine thousand books. In doing so, he reveals the hidden impact of memory on our lives, and shows how we can all dramatically improve our memories. At a time when electronic devices have all but rendered our individual memories obsolete, Foer's book is a quest to resurrect the gift we all possess, but that too often slips our minds.</p>","Memory Craft, A Mind for Numbers, Ultralearning, Unlimited Memory, Accelerated Learning, How to Develop a Brilliant Memory Week by Week, Crystal Clear Communication, Peak, The Victorious Mind, Mastery, Same as Ever, The Richest Man in Babylon, The Pumpkin Plan, Why We Get Fat, Straight A at Stanford and on to Harvard: Teenager Version, How We Learn, Memory Exercises Now, How We Learn",https://audible.co.uk/pd/B0074EKOII?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.co.uk/bk/pauk/000219/bk_pauk_000219_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B0074EKOII,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51KJTAOgVAL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Joshua%20Foer%20-%20Moonwalking%20with%20Einstein,The Art and Science of Remembering Everything,,

That world is dead. </p> <p>Now, the world's money is traded by computer code, inside black boxes in heavily guarded buildings. Even the experts entrusted with your cash don't know what's happening to it. And the very few who do aren't about to tell - because they're making a killing. </p> <p>This is a market that's rigged, out of control and out of sight; a market in which the chief need is for speed; and in which traders would sell their grandmothers for a microsecond. Blink, and you'll miss it. </p> <p>In <i>Flash Boys</i>, Michael Lewis tells the explosive story of how one group of ingenious oddballs and misfits set out to expose what was going on. It's the story of what it's like to declare war on some of the richest and most powerful people in the world. It's about taking on an entire system. And it's about the madness that has taken hold of the financial markets today. </p> <p>You won't believe it until you've read it. </p> <p> Michael Lewis was born in New Orleans and educated at Princeton University and the London School of Economics. He has written several books including the New York Times bestsellers <i>Liar's Poker</i>, widely considered the book that defined Wall Street during the 1980s, <i>Boomerang</i> and <i>The Big Short</i>, 'probably the single best piece of financial journalism ever written' (Reuters).

How could we have all been so deluded for quite so long? Did it really have to be this way? And who the hell can we blame?

The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.</p> <p>Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible”.</p> <p>For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. In this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don’t know, and this second edition features a new philosophical and empirical essay, “On Robustness and Fragility”, which offers tools to navigate and exploit a Black Swan world.</p> <p>Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications, <i>The Black Swan</i> will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell.

When Cal Newport coined the term <i>deep work</i> on his popular blog, <i>Study Hacks</i>, in 2012, he found the concept quickly hit a nerve. Most of us, after all, are excruciatingly familiar with shallow work instead - distractedly skimming the surface of our workload and never getting to the important part. Newport began exploring the methods and mind-set that foster a practice of distraction-free productivity at work, and now, in <i>Deep Work</i>, he shows how anyone can achieve this elusive state. </p> <p>Through revealing portraits of both historical and modern-day thinkers, academics and leaders in the fields of technology, science and culture, and their deep work habits, Newport shares an inspiring collection of tools to wring every last drop of value out of your intellectual capacity. He explains why mastering this shift in work practices is crucial for anyone who intends to stay ahead in a complex information economy and how to systematically train the mind to focus. Put simply: developing and cultivating a deep work practice is one of the best decisions we can make in an increasingly distracted world. </p>","So Good They Can't Ignore You, Atomic Habits, Essentialism, The Psychology of Money, The ONE Thing, Digital Minimalism, How to Win Friends & Influence People, Indistractable, A World Without Email, The Psychology of High Self-Esteem, Get Out of Your Own Way, Building a Second Brain, $100M Leads, Open to Think, Make Time, Stolen Focus, Master Your Emotions and Ultralearning, The Productivity Project",https://audible.co.uk/pd/B01D0E32T8?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.co.uk/bk/twuk/001123/bk_twuk_001123_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B01D0E32T8,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51EJRm2IHOL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Cal%20Newport%20-%20Deep%20Work,Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,,

It is for mature audiences only. Just like the original graphic novels, this audio adaptation contains explicit language and graphic violence, as well as strong sexual content and themes. Discretion is advised. </b></p> <p>Hailed by the <i>Los Angeles Times Magazine</i> as “the greatest epic in the history of comic books”, <i>The Sandman </i>changed the game with its dark, literary world of fantasy and horror - creating a global, cultural phenomenon in the process. At long last, Audible and DC present the first-ever audio production of the<i> New York Times</i> best-selling series written by acclaimed storyteller Neil Gaiman (who also serves as co-executive producer). Adapted and directed by multi-award-winner (and frequent Gaiman collaborator) Dirk Maggs, and performed by an ensemble cast with James McAvoy (<i>It, Parts One and Two, X-Men: First Class, Split</i>) in the title role, this first installment of a multi-part original audio series will transport you to a world that re-writes the rules of audio entertainment the way that <i>The Sandman</i> originally re-defined the graphic novel.&nbsp;</p> <p>When The Sandman, also known as Lord Morpheus - the immortal king of dreams, stories and the imagination - is pulled from his realm and imprisoned on Earth by a nefarious cult, he languishes for decades before finally escaping. Once free, he must retrieve the three “tools” that will restore his power and help him to rebuild his dominion, which has deteriorated in his absence. As the multi-threaded story unspools, The Sandman descends into Hell to confront Lucifer (Michael Sheen), chases rogue nightmares who have escaped his realm, and crosses paths with an array of characters from DC comic books, ancient myths, and real-world history, including: Inmates of Gotham City's Arkham Asylum, Doctor Destiny, the muse Calliope, the three Fates, William Shakespeare (Arthur Darvill), and many more.&nbsp;</p> <p>A powerhouse supporting cast helps translate this masterwork into a sonic experience worthy of its legacy, including Riz Ahmed, Kat Dennings, Taron Egerton, Samantha Morton, Bebe Neuwirth, Andy Serkis, and more. Setting the stage for their performance is an unprecedented cinematic soundscape featuring an original musical score by British Academy Award winner James Hannigan. Fans will especially revel in a new twist for the audio adaptation: Neil Gaiman himself serves as the narrator. Follow him as he leads listeners along a winding path of myths, imagination and, often, terror.

One system is fast, intuitive and emotional; the other is slower, more deliberative and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities-and also the faults and biases-of fast thinking and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behaviour. The importance of properly framing risks, the effects of cognitive biases on how we view others, the dangers of prediction, the right ways to develop skills, the pros and cons of fear and optimism, the difference between our experience and memory of events, the real components of happiness-each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgements and decisions.</p> <p>Drawing on a lifetime's experimental experience, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking.

Most people call to mind a familiar definition: a seasoned manager with deep industry expertise. Others might point to the qualities of today's so-called celebrity CEOs charisma, virtuoso communication skills, and a confident management style. But what really matters when you run an organization? What is the hallmark of exceptional CEO performance? Quite simply, it is the returns for the shareholders of that company over the long term. </p> <p>In this refreshing, counterintuitive audiobook, author Will Thorndike brings to bear the analytical wisdom of a successful career in investing, closely evaluating the performance of companies and their leaders. You will meet eight individualistic CEOs whose firms' average returns outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a factor of twenty in other words, an investment of $10,000 with each of these CEOs, on average, would have been worth over $1.5 million twenty-five years later. You may not know all their names, but you will recognize their companies: General Cinema, Ralston Purina, The Washington Post Company, Berkshire Hathaway, General Dynamics, Capital Cities Broadcasting, TCI, and Teledyne. </p> <p>In <i>The Outsiders</i>, you'll learn the traits and methods striking for their consistency and relentless rationality that helped these unique leaders achieve such exceptional performance. Humble, unassuming, and often frugal, these ""outsiders"" shunned Wall Street and the press, and shied away from the hottest new management trends. Instead, they shared specific traits that put them and the companies they led on winning trajectories: a laser-sharp focus on per share value as opposed to earnings or sales growth; an exceptional talent for allocating capital and human resources; and the belief that cash flow, not reported earnings, determines a company's long-term value. </p> <p>Drawing on years of research and experience, Thorndike tells eye-opening stories, extracting lessons and revealing a compelling alternative model for anyone interested in leading a company or investing in one and reaping extraordinary returns. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</b></p>","100 Baggers, Good to Great, Berkshire Beyond Buffett, The Essays of Warren Buffett, The Most Important Thing, Same as Ever, Quality Investing, The Investment Checklist, 100 to 1 in the Stock Market, How to Invest, University of Berkshire Hathaway, 7 Powers, The Education of a Value Investor, The 10X Mentor, The Great Mental Models, Volume 2, Principles, The Warren Buffett Way, Where the Money Is",https://audible.co.uk/pd/B00F3HXD68?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.co.uk/bk/adbl/014425/bk_adbl_014425_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B00F3HXD68,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41OHFqmzx+L._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=William%20N.%20Thorndike%20-%20The%20Outsiders,Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,,

It is an integral, unchallenged and essential component of our modern social, mercantile, scientific, mechanical and intellectual landscapes. The items we value in our daily lives - a camera, a phone, a computer, a bicycle, a car, a dishwasher perhaps - all sport components that fit together with precision and operate with near perfection. We also assume that the more precise a device the better it is. And yet whilst we live lives peppered and larded with precision, we are not, when we come to think about it, entirely sure what precision is or what it means. How and when did it begin to build the modern world?</p> <p>Simon Winchester seeks to answer these questions through stories of precision’s pioneers. <i>Exactly</i> takes us back to the origins of the Industrial Age, to Britain where he introduces the scientific minds that helped usher in modern production: John ‘Iron-Mad’ Wilkinson, Henry Maudslay, Joseph Bramah, Jesse Ramsden and Joseph Whitworth. Thomas Jefferson exported their discoveries to the United States as manufacturing developed in the early 20th century, with Britain’s Henry Royce developing the Rolls-Royce and Henry Ford mass producing cars, Hattori’s Seiko and Leica lenses, to today’s cutting-edge developments from Europe, Asia and North America.</p> <p>As he introduces the minds and methods that have changed the modern world, Winchester explores fundamental questions. Why is precision important? What are the different tools we use to measure it? Who has invented and perfected it? Has the pursuit of the ultra-precise in so many facets of human life blinded us to other things of equal value, such as an appreciation for the age-old traditions of craftsmanship, art, and high culture? Are we missing something that reflects the world as it is rather than the world as we think we would wish it to be? And can the precise and the natural coexist in society?</p>","Knowing What We Know, Land, The Meaning of Everything, Degree in a Book: Philosophy, Pacific: The Ocean of the Future, The Surgeon of Crowthorne, Adventures from the Technology Underground, Beyond Measure, AC/DC, To Forgive Design, Stuff Matters, They Made America, Material World, Guns, Germs and Steel, How to Build a Car, Powers and Thrones, Periodic Tales, Leonardo Da Vinci",https://audible.co.uk/pd/B07CQ3RPKC?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.co.uk/bk/hcuk/003955/bk_hcuk_003955_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B07CQ3RPKC,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/415t7UebiEL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Simon%20Winchester%20-%20Exactly,How Precision Engineers Created the Modern World,,

He then shows you how to use these simple analytical tools to understand what you see through those lenses.

And after these dozen lectures with Professor Bartlett, things really will look very different. You'll see how basic economic ideas like incentives, risks, rewards, and rationality are not just the province of professional economists, government policymakers, or your local bank's loan officer, but instead lie at the root of nearly every decision you must make in your daily life.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your Library section along with the audio.</b></p>","Foundations of Economic Prosperity, Macroeconomics Made Clear, Crashes and Crises: Lessons from a History of Financial Disasters, The Philosopher's Toolkit: How to Be the Most Rational Person in Any Room, Skepticism 101: How to Think like a Scientist, Einstein's Relativity and the Quantum Revolution: Modern Physics for Non-Scientists, 2nd Edition, The Learning Brain, Understanding Investments, The Great Ideas of Philosophy, 2nd Edition, Understanding the Mysteries of Human Behavior, Food: A Cultural Culinary History, Think like a Stoic, The Great Mental Models, Volume 2, More Money than God, The Communist Manifesto, The Most Important Thing, Start Now.

He used many of these holiday settings for his children's stories, notably the much-loved Swallows and Amazons, a book that sits comfortably in the category of ‘timeless classic’.

But if this is the case, why are we living in such fractured times, with global populism on the rise and wealth inequality as stark as ever? </p> <p>In this book, author and prize-winning journalist David Pilling demystifies gross domestic product, a tool that measures the goods and services a country produces in a set period. Revered by economists, GDP is considered evidence of a country's success and well-being. Yet GDP is actually, at best, a numbers game, unequipped to deal with the nuances of the digital economy and developing nations. It also lacks moral judgment: such is the drive for growth that heroin consumption is valued more than volunteer work. By fixating on GDP, experts are ignoring alternative models that better reflect reality and ushering in policies that could even harm us. </p> <p>In characteristically clear and lively prose, Pilling draws on a quarter century of reporting to argue that our steadfast loyalty to GDP is informing misguided policies - and contributing to a growing mistrust of experts that is shaking the foundations of our democracy. We live in a society in which a priesthood of economists, wielding impenetrable mathematical formulas, sets the framework for public debate. Ultimately, it is economists who set the agenda for how much we can spend on our schools, highways, and defence; who decide how much unemployment is acceptable and whether it is right to print money or bail out profligate banks. The backlash we are currently witnessing suggests that people are turning against the economists and their faulty representation of our lives. </p> <p>Despite decades of steady economic growth, many citizens feel more pessimistic than ever and are voting for candidates who voice undisguised contempt for the technocratic elite. For too long economics has relied on a language which fails to resonate with people's lived experience, and we are now living with the consequences. </p>","Bad Science, What a Wonderful World, 23 Things They Don't Tell You about Capitalism, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, The Establishment, Chavs, Utopia for Realists, Why We Get The Wrong Politicians, Necessary Illusions, A Thousand Brains, The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism, Rollback, The Upside of Down, The Undercover Economist Strikes Back, If Only They Didn't Speak English, Milton Friedman, A Line in the Sand, Snafu: Perspectives on the 'Accelerated Age'",https://audible.co.uk/pd/B077BK57K4?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.co.uk/bk/adbl/031977/bk_adbl_031977_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B077BK57K4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51atYxjLd-L._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=David%20Pilling%20-%20The%20Growth%20Delusion,Why Economists Are Getting It Wrong and What We Can Do About It,,

He provides interesting and often quirky stories of the lives and deaths of thought-provoking philosophers from Socrates, who chose to die by hemlock poisoning rather than live on without the freedom to think for himself, to Peter Singer, who asks the disquieting philosophical and ethical questions that haunt our own times. </p> <p>Warburton not only makes philosophy accessible, he offers inspiration to think, argue, reason, and ask in the tradition of Socrates. <i>A Little History of Philosophy</i> presents the grand sweep of humanity's search for philosophical understanding and invites all to join in the discussion.</p>","A Little History of the World, Ancestors, Lost at Sea: The Jon Ronson Mysteries, H.

Astonishing in its candor <i>The Prince</i> even today remains a disturbingly realistic and prophetic work on what it takes to be a prince, a king, or a president. When Machiavelli was removed from his post in his beloved Florence, he resolved to set down a treatise on leadership that was practical, not idealistic. The Prince he envisioned would be unencumbered by ordinary ethical and moral values.

Then meet DI Hillary Greene, a policewoman struggling to save her career and catch criminals.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fifteen-year-old Billy Davies is found dead in his father's shed with a pair of gardening shears thrust brutally into his chest. DI Hillary Greene tries to get to the bottom of this baffling crime. How did Billy come into contact with such a vicious killer? Who wanted him dead - and why? The investigation reveals that the teenager was not such an innocent young man. Meanwhile, Hillary's having a tough time at work. She's been passed over for promotion, and her reliable constable Tommy Lynch is to be transferred out. But Hillary won't let distractions get in the way of solving crimes. To catch this killer, she will need to dig deep into the dark secrets of a small community. <i>Murder in the Family</i> is the fifth in a series of crime thrillers set in Oxfordshire.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The Location</b><br> The crime happens in an allotment shed in a small Oxfordshire hamlet. Allotments, or strips of land rented by individuals to grow fruit and vegetables (or flowers for flower shows), have always been popular. During the war years, they were a valuable source of food, and in modern times, their popularity hasn’t waned either, as the growing taste for organic fruit and veg, and ‘getting back to nature’ appeals to a wide range of people. Beekeepers find them very useful too. Waiting lists can be long, as they represent a perfect way to de-stress after a day in the city, and provide a peaceful haven for many people. But in the tiny hamlet of Aston Lea, set in fields of barley, and sheltered from the world and the roads by towering Hawthorne hedges, the allotments are a perfect, secret, quiet place to commit murder.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The Detectives</b> <br> DI Hillary Greene: An attractive woman in her forties, Hillary Greene is a police officer of many years’ experience, and came up through the ranks. Consequently, she knows how the system works, and is fiercely loyal to the force without being blinkered to its faults. She is a long-standing friend of her immediate superior officer, 'Mellow' Mallow and enjoys a rather enigmatic relationship with the steely Superintendent Marcus Donleavy. Popular with the rank and file for her no-nonsense attitude and competence.&nbsp;</p> <p>DCI Philip 'Mellow' Mallow: Mel appreciates Hillary's first-rate ability to solve her cases, and isn't happy about her harassment by the officers from York. Known for his sartorial elegance and laid-back manners, he has a sharp mind, and an eye for the ladies. A good friend and ally for Hillary in her recent tribulations, he's determined to keep his best investigator focused on the problems at hand.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Please note this is a revised edition of a book first published as </b><b><i>Through a Narrow Door</i></b><b>.</b>&nbsp;</p>","The Flower Show Murder, A Fatal Obsession, The Birthday Mystery, A Fatal End, Locked In, Say It With Poison, Mitchell and Markby Village, Book 1, Murder by the Minster, Date with Death, The Landscape of Death, The Bookshop Murder, Mud, Muck and Dead Things, A Real Shot in the Arm, Sins of the Fathers, Murder in Tuscany, Death at the Auction, An English Garden Murder, Grimm Up North, The Railway Detective",https://audible.co.uk/pd/B07CF4LWGW?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.co.uk/bk/howe/004342/bk_howe_004342_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B07CF4LWGW,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51nLZvMeztL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Faith%20Martin%20-%20Murder%20in%20the%20Family,,,

In contrast to Mary Shelley, who was often overshadowed by her husband's work, Stevenson lived comfortably by his pen.&nbsp;</p> <p>It was only with the release of <i>Frankenstein</i> that Shelley finally distinguished herself. <i>Frankenstein</i> was groundbreaking in its ability to fuse passion and romance with gore and horror.&nbsp;</p> <p>Narrated by Dan Stevens, who rose to fame through <i>Downton Abbey</i>, and <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, the story of science student Victor Frankenstein has been artfully retold.&nbsp;</p> <p>Testing the limits of science, Frankenstein fashions a living being from the conjoined body parts of rotting cadavers. Horrified at the end result, he abandons his monster, leaving him to endure a life of isolation and loneliness.&nbsp;</p> <p>A poignant example of human weakness and our inability to take responsibility for our actions, <i>Frankenstein</i> is both moving and terrifying.&nbsp;</p> <p>That leads us to the gruesome tale of Count Dracula, the bloodthirsty father of the undead.&nbsp;</p> <p>Narrated by Greg Wise, star of <i>The Crown</i> and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>; Greg depicts a young lawyer whose services are hired by a sinister Transylvanian count.&nbsp;</p> <p>Releasing <i>Dracula</i> 80 years after <i>Frankenstein</i>, Bram Stoker was greatly influenced by Shelley's writing style and similarly propels the story along through diary entries, letters and newspaper cuttings. Possessed of grisly imagery and unexpected twists, it's no wonder that <i>Dracula</i> still manages to shake us to our very core.&nbsp;</p> <p>All that remains is to offer a note of caution: this collection is not for the fainthearted. Old as these tales may be, do not mistake the unsettling nature of their content.&nbsp;</p> <p>Grab some popcorn, turn the speakers up and enjoy.

It needs to be built and designed for ""the average"". Society, by moral necessity, also needs to focus on the disadvantaged and disabled, helping those who cannot help themselves. But while the majority of society's resources, attention, and infrastructure is dedicated to average or below-average people, little-to-none of it is dedicated to the abnormally intelligent. And while having a high IQ is an overall net benefit in life, being a statistical intellectual freak is not without its drawbacks. Welcome to <i>The Curse of the High IQ</i>. </p> <p>Whether you fall asleep during class, constantly ram heads with your boss, can't understand why people watch the Oscars, are an alcoholic, or are accused of having ADD, having a high IQ can be a maddening experience. What you see as the obvious solution is what the ""normies"" will fight against tooth and nail. Those Ds you keep getting in English? Your superior mind being held hostage by the boring and inferior mind of your teacher. And you'd like to start a family? Good luck finding an intellectual equal for a spouse. And so while the world obsesses on their own problems, no one is paying attention to the problems of the abnormally intelligent. However, that all changes now with <i>Curse of the High IQ</i>. </p> <p><i>Curse of the High IQ</i> is the first book specifically written for abnormally intelligent people. It identifies and addresses a litany of problems intelligent people face, analyzes them and provides solutions.

Alison will reluctantly play the part of PI, but when the clues take a sinister turn, the writing is on the wall: If Alison can’t keep a level head, this will be her father’s final act—and maybe her own. </p>","An Open Spook, Cozy Witch Mysteries: Special Edition Box Set of 8 Books, Dog Dish of Doom, Murder Past Due, The Babbling Brook Naked Poker Club, Book One, Edge of Evil, The Tale of Halcyon Crane, Miss Me When I'm Gone, Uncommon Grounds, The Touch, When Lightning Strikes, The Hunt Club, Donn's Hill, Sign Off, Savannah Blues, The Gates of Evangeline, The Only Suspect, Death Overdue",https://audible.co.uk/pd/B00G3BPKA0?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.co.uk/bk/adbl/011858/bk_adbl_011858_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B00G3BPKA0,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51AWcSg-iyL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=E.J.%20Copperman%20-%20Chance%20of%20a%20Ghost,,,

Award-winning journalist Johann Hari suffered from depression since he was a child and started taking antidepressants when he was a teenager. He was told that his problems were caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. As an adult, trained in the social sciences, he began to investigate whether this was true - and he learned that almost everything we have been told about depression and anxiety is wrong. </p> <p>Across the world, Hari found social scientists who were uncovering evidence that depression and anxiety are not caused by a chemical imbalance in our brains. In fact, they are largely caused by key problems with the way we live today. Hari's journey took him from a mind-blowing series of experiments in Baltimore, to an Amish community in Indiana, to an uprising in Berlin. </p> <p>Once he had uncovered nine real causes of depression and anxiety, they led him to scientists who are discovering seven very different solutions - ones that work. It is an epic journey that will change how we think about one of the biggest crises in our culture today. </p>","Stolen Focus, Chasing the Scream, The Myth of Normal, The Upward Spiral, Hardcore Self Help: F**k Depression, Dopamine Nation, The Complete George Smiley Radio Dramas, The Body Keeps the Score, 12 Rules for Life, Take Control of Your Life, Fake Heroes, The Devil You Know, Tools of Titans, Money, In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, How to Be Alive, How to Change Your Mind, The Noonday Demon",https://audible.co.uk/pd/B078HDTXBM?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.co.uk/bk/adbl/032468/bk_adbl_032468_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B078HDTXBM,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ys5VO30RL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Johann%20Hari%20-%20Lost%20Connections,Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression - and the Unexpected Solutions,,

What did these everyday people do for a living? What was their home like? What did they eat? What did they wear? What did they do to relax? What were their beliefs about marriage? Religion? The afterlife? </p> <p>This extraordinary journey takes you across space and time in an effort to be another person - someone with whom you might not think you have anything at all in common - and come away with an incredible sense of interconnectedness.

Thaler has spent his career studying the radical notion that the central agents in the economy are humans - predictable, error-prone individuals. <i>Misbehaving</i> is his arresting, frequently hilarious account of the struggle to bring an academic discipline back down to earth - and change the way we think about economics, ourselves, and our world. </p> <p>Traditional economics assumes rational actors. Early in his research, Thaler realized these Spock-like automatons were nothing like real people. Whether buying a clock radio, selling basketball tickets, or applying for a mortgage, we all succumb to biases and make decisions that deviate from the standards of rationality assumed by economists. In other words we misbehave. More importantly, our misbehavior has serious consequences. Dismissed at first by economists as an amusing sideshow, the study of human miscalculations and their effects on markets now drives efforts to make better decisions in our lives, our businesses, and our governments. </p> <p>Coupling recent discoveries in human psychology with a practical understanding of incentives and market behavior, Thaler enlightens listeners about how to make smarter decisions in an increasingly mystifying world. He reveals how behavioral economic analysis opens up new ways to look at everything from household finance to assigning faculty offices in a new building, to TV game shows, the NFL draft, and businesses like Uber. </p> <p>Laced with antic stories of Thaler's spirited battles with the bastions of traditional economic thinking, <i>Misbehaving</i> is a singular look into profound human foibles. When economics meets psychology, the implications for individuals, managers, and policy makers are both profound and entertaining. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</b></p>","The House of Morgan, The Art of Thinking Clearly, The Dip, Bad Pharma, Tribes, The Money Formula, The Ponzi Factor, Nudge: The Final Edition, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Everybody Lies, The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution, Predictably Irrational, Foundations of Economic Prosperity, Gravitas, Nudge, The End of Bias, Maybe You Should Talk to Someone, The Great Mental Models, Volume 2",https://audible.co.uk/pd/B00VQTLR60?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.co.uk/bk/adbl/022796/bk_adbl_022796_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B00VQTLR60,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51LsfuzFU7L._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Richard%20H.%20Thaler%20-%20Misbehaving,The Making of Behavioral Economics,,

Well, sort of. Life on Artemis, the first and only city on the moon, is tough if you're not a rich tourist or an eccentric billionaire. So smuggling in the occasional harmless bit of contraband barely counts, right? Not when you've got debts to pay and your job as a porter barely covers the rent. </p> <p>Everything changes when Jazz sees the chance to commit the perfect crime, with a reward too lucrative to turn down. But pulling off the impossible is just the start of her problems, as she learns that she's stepped square into a conspiracy for control of Artemis itself - and that now her only chance at survival lies in a gambit even riskier than the first. </p> <p>Bringing to life Weir's brash, whip-smart protagonist is actress Rosario Dawson (Marvel's <i>The Defenders</i>, <i>Sin City</i>, <i>Death Proof</i>). With the breathless immediacy of one realizing they're one cracked helmet visor away from oblivion, Dawson deftly captures Jazz's first-person perspective – all while delivering sarcastic Weir-ian one-liners and cracking wise in the face of death. And with a cast of diverse characters from all walks of life calling Artemis home, Dawson tonally somersaults to voice Kenyan prime ministers, Ukrainian scientists, and Saudi welders. It's a performance that transports listeners right alongside Jazz, matching her step for step on every lunar inch of her pulse-pounding journey. </p>","The Martian, Project Hail Mary, Children of Time, The Egg and Other Stories, Armada, Dark Matter, Ready Player One, 14, The Collapsing Empire, Lost in Time, Drive, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Star Wars: Convergence, The Eighth Continent, Running Start, Thrive Space Colony Adventures, Randomize",https://audible.co.uk/pd/B0721NKM4B?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.co.uk/bk/adbl/027881/bk_adbl_027881_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B0721NKM4B,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fisVXQNrL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Andy%20Weir%20-%20Artemis,,,

He carved the face above a well that is much older. How much older, no one knows, but it's centuries older, or even more. And why did he carve it? He carved it to mark that here is the Wizard's Well.</p> <p>I am Joseph's grandson, and I grew up on that hill, Alderley Edge in Cheshire, aware of its magic and accepting it. I didn't know that it wasn't the same for everyone. I didn't know that not all children played, by day and by night, the year long, on a wooded hill where heroes slept in the ground. Yet there were strange things. Below another ancient well, the Holy Well, a rock lies in a bog. It fell from the cliff above in 1740 and made the Garners' cottage shake. It landed on an old woman and her cow that, for some reason, were standing in the bog, and, as a result, are still there. When I was seven, the bog was dangerous for somebody of my size and I once got stuck in it and thought I was going to drown, even though I sank only to my hips; but I managed to reach the rock and to climb up it to where a fallen tree was lodged, which spanned the bog, and by sliding along the trunk I was able to reach firm land. Nearby, under the leaf mould, is a layer of white clay that we used as soap to wash ourselves before we went home after playing. But there wasn't anything I could do about my clothes, and Grandad was not pleased.</p> <p>The Edge is a land of two worlds: above and below. It took me my childhood to learn about above; when I was 19, I went to learn the wonders of below: a world of darkness and silence, so dark that you can see the lights of brain cells discharging; so silent that blood in the veins can be heard. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying reference material will be available in your My Library section along with the audio.</b></p>","The Moon of Gomrath, The Owl Service, Elidor, Treacle Walker, Over Sea, Under Stone, Where Shall We Run To?, Watchers: The Coming of the King, The Legend of Huma, Children of the Plains, Clive Barker's First Tales, The Wolves of Willoughby Chase, Black Hearts in Battersea & The Story of Is, Mythago Wood, The Crystal Cave, The Lost Sounds, The Mabinogion, The Night Land: A Story Retold, Pilgrim Series 5-7, The Silmarillion",https://audible.co.uk/pd/B004EWSU3E?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true,https://samples.audible.co.uk/bk/naxo/000317/bk_naxo_000317_sample.mp3,https://www.audible.com/webplayer?asin=B004EWSU3E,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51UT6mZ16zL._SL500_.jpg,https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=Alan%20Garner%20-%20The%20Weirdstone%20of%20Brisingamen,,,

That trying to change bad habits can seem impossible? Or that real fulfillment can be elusive, despite living a successful life?&nbsp;</p> <p>Often, such difficulties stem from the human brain's hardwired tendency to seek pleasure and avoid pain. Modern science demonstrates that this survival mechanism served the needs of our earliest ancestors, but is at the root of many problems that we face today, such as depression, compulsive and addictive behaviors, chronic pain, and stress and anxiety.&nbsp;</p> <p>For thousands of years, people have used mindfulness practices to deal effectively with a wide range of life challenges. But how exactly does mindfulness work, in scientific terms? How can the human brain, which gives rise to so many of our problems, actually provide a solution?&nbsp;</p> <p>We are now in the midst of an explosion of scientific research demonstrating that mindfulness practice changes both the function and the structure of the brain.

In <i>Rewire Your Anxious Brain</i>, psychologist Catherine Pittman and author Elizabeth Karle offer a unique, evidence-based solution to overcoming anxiety, based in cutting-edge neuroscience and research. </p> <p>In this audiobook you will learn how the amygdala and cortex (both important parts of the brain) are essential players in the neuropsychology of anxiety. The amygdala acts as a primal response, and oftentimes, when this part of the brain processes fear, you may not even understand why you are afraid. By comparison the cortex is the center of worry - that is, obsessing, ruminating, and dwelling on things that may or may not happen. </p> <p>Pittman and Karle offer simple, specific examples of how to manage fear by tapping in to both of these pathways in the brain.
